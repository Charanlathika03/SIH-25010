## Problem Title
**SIH 25010: AI-Driven Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers**

---

## Problem Description
Small and marginal farmers, who make up the majority of India’s agricultural community, often rely on guesswork or traditional knowledge for critical decisions such as which crop to grow, how much fertilizer to use, or how to control pests. Limited access to scientific advisory services, language barriers, and low digital literacy leave them vulnerable to low yields, higher costs, and environmental harm due to overuse of chemicals.  

A smart, accessible advisory platform can help farmers make informed, data-driven choices that directly improve productivity, reduce risks, and ensure sustainability.

---

## Why This Problem Matters
- Boosts crop yield and farmers’ income.  
- Reduces dependence on unscientific or biased advice.  
- Promotes sustainable farming and minimizes environmental damage.  
- Empowers farmers with tools available in their own language and through simple interfaces.  

---

## Expected Outcomes
- AI-powered advisory application (mobile app or chatbot).  
- Multilingual support for farmers.  
- Real-time weather and soil-based recommendations.  
- Pest/disease detection from images.  
- Smart fertilizer and crop suggestions.  
- Voice assistant for less digitally literate users.  
- Market price updates for crops.  

---

## Beneficiaries
- Farmers (especially small and marginal landholders).  
- Agricultural extension officers and state departments.  
- NGOs working in rural development.  
- Startups and agri-tech innovators.  

---

## Supporting Facts
- **86%** of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).  
- Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by **20–30%**.

## Proposed Solution
An AI-based mobile and web platform that delivers **personalized crop advisory** using inputs such as soil data, weather forecasts, and farm history. The system will:  
- Provide localized and multilingual insights.  
- Recommend fertilizers and crop protection techniques.  
- Predict pest/disease risks using ML models.  
- Support voice-based interaction for ease of use.  

---

## Technical Approach
- **Frontend:** React Native (mobile) / React.js (web).  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Django REST API.  
- **AI/ML Models:** Crop recommendation, pest detection (image classification), yield prediction.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB.  
- **External APIs:** Weather data, market price APIs.  
- **Workflow:**  
  1. Farmer inputs (location, crop, soil test, images).  
  2. ML models process and generate recommendations.  
  3. Advisory delivered in text, voice, and local language.  

---

## Feasibility & Viability
- Uses existing data sources (weather, soil, market prices).  
- Leverages scalable cloud infrastructure.  
- Possible challenges: internet availability, language diversity, trust in technology.  
- Mitigation: offline mode, regional language packs, farmer training.  

---

## Impact & Benefits
- **Social:** Empowers farmers with reliable knowledge.  
- **Economic:** Higher productivity, lower input costs.  
- **Environmental:** Reduced overuse of fertilizers and pesticides.  
- **Long Term:** Supports food security and rural development.
